      <description>&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed this one-button, driving &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drivey-car/id1062091463?mt=8&#34;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; in which you could &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; steer left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay consists of driving round the same simple track until you crashed. Personally, it captured that &lt;a href=&#34;http://glitchwall.com/post/flappy-birds-difficulty&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;frustration aesthetic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; of Flappy Bird in a way that Crossy Road never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow coins, the in-game currency, spawn as you go around the track. There are also red coins, which make you go faster and leave flaming tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered my first blue coin shortly after reaching a score of 10. I was not expecting it at all when my car started swerving wildy, and I promptly wrecked my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WTF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was such a defining moment between the game and me, because it became this personal &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;. I may have played Flappy Bird for a much longer time, but no stories ever came out of it because all the pipes were the same and there was no specific point around which a story could form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these simple coins have a great deal of merit as a game mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red coins primed players to expect interesting effects from picking up colored coins. And the great thing was, these red coins didn&amp;rsquo;t feel punishing. Going faster made the game harder, but not by that much. Besides, going fast &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; good, and flaming tracks are cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense red coins were really a gentle introduction to their more brutal blue cousins. But even though the swerving felt random and wild initially, I eventually developed an intuition for driving under their influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game, these coins carved out the peaks and troughs of my excitment level. Here are some examples of my inner thoughts while playing the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just cruising along&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m doing GREAT!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coin spawned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;d better be careful not to pick that up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accidentally picked up coin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Oh shit oh shit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coin effect wore off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Phew! I&amp;rsquo;m doing GREAT!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that these coins never felt unfair, because it’s always my fault when I couldn’t avoid them. They&amp;rsquo;re a great way of providing progressively harder challenges to overcome, and they make players wonder what&amp;rsquo;s gonna come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it to 30 rounds, but I crashed before any new colored coin spawned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flappy Bird&#39;s Difficulty</title>
      <link>http://glitchwall.com/post/flappy-birds-difficulty/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We tend to attribute the infuriatingly addictive nature of Flappy Bird to its maddening difficulty, but I think what really kept us playing was our constant indignation at how easy it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes easy to miss the difference when designing a game with a similar &amp;ldquo;frustration aesthetic&amp;rdquo;. Such a game should be way harder than it looks, and yet still feel fair. (Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why Swing Copters never took off. That game &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; hard.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty ramp in Flappy Bird was a curious thing. Assuming that the probability of hitting a pipe was 10%, the probability of getting past the 5th gap would be 1 - (1 - 10%)^5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s approximately 40%, which is &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; than 10% * 5 = 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we associate probability with difficulty, this means getting past the fifth pipe isn&amp;rsquo;t five times as hard as passing the first; it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. The hundredth pipe feels so much more intense than the first because there is &lt;strong&gt;disproportionately&lt;/strong&gt; so much more to lose. (Related: Michael Brough’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://mightyvision.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/non-linear-costs.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on non-linear costs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we subconsciously recognise this without having to think through the math. Even as I write this I realize it’s kind of obvious, but I guess that’s part of why I keep this design notebook &amp;ndash; to formalize and understand at a deeper level why some of these things are “obvious”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I miss that game.&lt;/p&gt;
