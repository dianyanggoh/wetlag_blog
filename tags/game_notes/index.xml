      <title>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://agoodsnowman.com/&#34;&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an economic efficiency to the game&amp;rsquo;s design; no element is wasted. For example, there are no &amp;ldquo;screens&amp;rdquo;. Settings options appear as thought bubbles over the character&amp;rsquo;s head, and the map &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the puzzle. The benches which the character can sit on, along with other interactable environmental objects, initially seemed to be nothing more than neat touches with no gameplay impact, but were later revealed to be secret gateways. Even the humble reset button turned out to be a really important mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in awe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme informs the mechanics really well, so much so that it&amp;rsquo;s truly difficult to imagine the game being built around anything else. Puzzles you&amp;rsquo;ve solved(&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; snowmen) are left intact, and monument-like. They lend a sense of permanence and significance to your actions, which is then challenged in the secret second-half of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good secret is hard to build, too.  Often, secrets are inserted into games almost for the sake of having them; they tend to be merely something for players to find. Like the reveal at the end of the film &lt;em&gt;the Prestige&lt;/em&gt;, I think a good secret changes your understanding of everything up till its discovery. I think this game has managed to pull it off in an organic and elegant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a short and beautiful game. Ephemeral, like a snowman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beacon and Clairvoyant Bullets</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was searching around for this Ludum Dare &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necessarygames.com/reviews/beacon-game-free-download-independent-windows-atmospheric-fantasy-singleplayer-casual-gamers&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beacon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; game to play, but unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be available online anymore. I then somehow ended up playing this &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Ludum Dare &lt;a href=&#34;http://wootfu.com/beacon/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beacon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; game instead, and this is the one I&amp;rsquo;m writing about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around halfway through the game, you&amp;rsquo;re introduced to these turrets which shoot bullets at you. Except, they&amp;rsquo;re not shooting directly &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; you, but rather where they &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;ll end up. To avoid getting hit, you would have to change your behavior after a bullet had been fired. (e.g. Move or jump if you&amp;rsquo;d been standing still, change direction or stop or jump if you&amp;rsquo;d been moving, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, they&amp;rsquo;re not homing bullets. Merely clairvoyant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mechanic that&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to understand, but its consequences are a little more nuanced. There&amp;rsquo;s this subtle moment after &amp;ldquo;dodging a bullet&amp;rdquo; and watching it sail past when you acknowledge that hmmmm, yes, that would have hit me. It reminds me of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKl8CM1Cft4&#34;&gt;Oracle Billiards&lt;/a&gt; prototype that Jonathan Blow made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to try something by stringing together a few of these turrents, all of which would be firing in quick succession. As a player you would then have to constantly override your own decisions. I suspect that would feel rather frustrating, but at the same time I think it&amp;rsquo;d be this weird, interesting sort of frustration..?&lt;/p&gt;
