      <description>&lt;p&gt;We tend to attribute the infuriatingly addictive nature of Flappy Bird to its maddening difficulty, but I think what really kept us playing was our constant indignation at how easy it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes easy to miss the difference when designing a game with a similar &amp;ldquo;frustration aesthetic&amp;rdquo;. Such a game should be way harder than it looks, and yet still feel fair. (Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why Swing Copters never took off. That game &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; hard.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty ramp in Flappy Bird was a curious thing. Assuming that the probability of hitting a pipe was 10%, the probability of getting past the 5th gap would be 1 - (1 - 10%)^5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s approximately 40%, which is &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; than 10% * 5 = 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we associate probability with difficulty, this means getting past the fifth pipe isn&amp;rsquo;t five times as hard as passing the first; it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. The hundredth pipe feels so much more intense than the first because there is &lt;strong&gt;disproportionately&lt;/strong&gt; so much more to lose. (Related: Michael Brough’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://mightyvision.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/non-linear-costs.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on non-linear costs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we subconsciously recognise this without having to think through the math. Even as I write this I realize it’s kind of obvious, but I guess that’s part of why I keep this design notebook &amp;ndash; to formalize and understand at a deeper level why some of these things are “obvious”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I miss that game.&lt;/p&gt;
