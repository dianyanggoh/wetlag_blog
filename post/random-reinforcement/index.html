<h3 id="card-drawing-a-form-of-random-reinforcement:1a2a2d9aad363bad5fde9f7b42449725">Card-drawing: a Form of Random Reinforcement?</h3>

<p>The author gives the example of card-drawing, such as that in games like MtG or Hearthstone, as a form of random reinforcement. While I&rsquo;m familiar with the concept, I&rsquo;ve always thought of it in the contexts of MMO loot drops and the <em>gacha</em> mechanics we so often see now in mobile games.</p>

<p>I suppose I don&rsquo;t really consider card-drawing as a form of random reinforcemt because that feeling of hoping for a particular outcome isn&rsquo;t very consistent throughout an entire match.</p>

<p>At the start of a match, you feel excited as you hope for a good starting hand. And in subsequent card draws, there may be specific scenarios in which you&rsquo;re praying really hard for a specific card(e.g. a good 2-drop, a counter, combo, etc). But notice how the desired card changes from turn to turn, and also that in general, each card draw fills you with <strong>varying intensities</strong> of anticipation.</p>

<p>Not all card draws were created equal.</p>

<p>Perhaps for that reason, Hearthstone may be addictive as a <em>game</em>, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever been addicted to the specific act of <em>drawing cards</em> itself. (&ldquo;Okay just one more card. Promise.&rdquo;) Contrast this with the just-one-more-try sentiment when playing Blackjack or a slot machine.</p>

<h3 id="ethics-vs-values:1a2a2d9aad363bad5fde9f7b42449725">Ethics vs Values</h3>

<p>Is the use of random reinforcement in games ethical? I doubt that absolute morality exists, so I tend not to think in those terms these days. Arguments about ethics tend to accomplish very little anyway. Instead, I find it more productive to consider what I value personally, and let these values guide my decisions.</p>

<p>Personally, getting people addicted to gambling, to buying and opening card packs, or to grinding endlessly for loot isn&rsquo;t very admirable. (Again, I&rsquo;m not passing any judgement here; I&rsquo;m merely staing that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d like to spend my time and effort on that.)</p>

<p>On the flip side, I think about a game like the Binding of Isaac which I&rsquo;ve sunk countless hours into. A big part of its appeal comes from that anticipation before entering an item room or devil room, and knowing that I <em>could</em> get some super awesome item combo. Most roguelikes, with their random elements, tend to generate similar experiences. That&rsquo;s random reinforcement right there.</p>

<p>For me, the Binding of Isaac is not just incredibly fun and addictive. It is also a beautiful game. So why is random reinforcement so distasteful in one scenario and yet palatable, even glorified perhaps in the other?</p>

<p>Is it a matter of degree? Of intention? Of context?</p>

<p>(Side note: The article mentioned that slot machines very frequently show an &ldquo;almost win&rdquo; oucome. Are the odds actually skewed towards that? That&rsquo;s just crazy manipulative.)</p>
