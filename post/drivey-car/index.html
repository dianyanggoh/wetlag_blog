      <p>I quite enjoyed this one-button, driving <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drivey-car/id1062091463?mt=8">game</a> in which you could <strong>only</strong> steer left.</p>

<p>The gameplay consists of driving round the same simple track until you crashed. Personally, it captured that <a href="http://glitchwall.com/post/flappy-birds-difficulty">&ldquo;frustration aesthetic&rdquo;</a> of Flappy Bird in a way that Crossy Road never did.</p>

<p>Yellow coins, the in-game currency, spawn as you go around the track. There are also red coins, which make you go faster and leave flaming tracks.</p>

<p>I encountered my first blue coin shortly after reaching a score of 10. I was not expecting it at all when my car started swerving wildy, and I promptly wrecked my car.</p>

<p><em>WTF.</em></p>

<p>But it was such a defining moment between the game and me, because it became this personal <em>story</em>. I may have played Flappy Bird for a much longer time, but no stories ever came out of it because all the pipes were the same and there was no specific point around which a story could form.</p>

<p>I think these simple coins have a great deal of merit as a game mechanic.</p>

<p>The red coins primed players to expect interesting effects from picking up colored coins. And the great thing was, these red coins didn&rsquo;t feel punishing. Going faster made the game harder, but not by that much. Besides, going fast <em>feels</em> good, and flaming tracks are cool.</p>

<p>In that sense red coins were really a gentle introduction to their more brutal blue cousins. But even though the swerving felt random and wild initially, I eventually developed an intuition for driving under their influence.</p>

<p>Throughout the game, these coins carved out the peaks and troughs of my excitment level. Here are some examples of my inner thoughts while playing the game:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Just cruising along</strong><br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing GREAT!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Coin spawned</strong><br />
&ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;d better be careful not to pick that up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Accidentally picked up coin</strong><br />
&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh shit oh shit.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Coin effect wore off</strong><br />
&ldquo;Phew! I&rsquo;m doing GREAT!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love that these coins never felt unfair, because it’s always my fault when I couldn’t avoid them. They&rsquo;re a great way of providing progressively harder challenges to overcome, and they make players wonder what&rsquo;s gonna come next.</p>

<p>I made it to 30 rounds, but I crashed before any new colored coin spawned.</p>

<p>And I wonder.</p>
