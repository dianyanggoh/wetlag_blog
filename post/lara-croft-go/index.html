      <p>I have a fondness for the Tomb Raider series.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, I played the first four games in the franchise as my dad sat beside me and gave suggestions when I inevitably got stuck. We bought guidebooks and somehow still managed to get lost sometimes. The first guidebooks were black and white, and the screenshots weren’t very clear. I remember how excited I was when they were finally printed in colour.</p>

<p>Lara Craft Go is the first Tomb Raider game I’d played since then and even though the gameplay was very different, it wafted nostalgia. It&rsquo;s not just the radial menu and the occasional handstand. It&rsquo;s that sense of wonder exploring ancient monuments filled with traps and treasure.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s well executed, and gorgeous.</p>

<p>Mechanics were gently introduced, and then reused and recombined. For example:<br />
-  Pressure plates could be deactivated by killing the creatures standing on them.<br />
-  Torches that protected you against the creatures could also &ldquo;push&rdquo; them back onto pressure plates.<br />
-  Pillars could stop rolling boulders, block dart traps, alter the creatures&rsquo; paths. They could be pushed onto pressure plates, onto creatures, and onto other pillars.</p>

<p>I think this is a concept Jon Blow and Marc Ten Bosch called &ldquo;compatibility of mechanics&rdquo; in their <a href="https://youtu.be/OGSeLSmOALU?t=2311">talk</a>. (There are a few other &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; from the talk which applies to this game too.)</p>

<p>The controls for this game surprised me; I had expected the character to move to where I tapped, like in Monument Valley. Diagonal swipes felt a little unnatural at first, but were easy enough to get used to. This may be the first time I&rsquo;ve seen a swipe-based control scheme in an isometric game.</p>

<p>I think something like the tracing controls in <a href="http://wetlag.com/post/a-good-snowman">A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</a> would have worked well in this game. With turn-based games like this, it usually takes a few moves just to perform that one action you have in mind. In your head you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;I want to push that pillar there.&rdquo;, but it translates into <em>swipe</em>, <em>swipe</em>, <em>swipe</em> to move to the pillar, and then <em>swipe</em>, <em>swipe</em>, <em>swipe</em> again to move it to your destination. It&rsquo;s a very subtle thing, but I think the inefficient mapping from thought to execution makes the experience less smooth.</p>

<p>I surprised myself a little by enjoying this game, even if it wasn&rsquo;t very challenging and many a time I was replaying levels and pixel-hunting for the secret vases in the game. (<strong>Aside:</strong> It amazes me how strange and nebulous and even hollow I still find the concept of fun &ndash; this subjective, swirling, conglomerate mess of even <em>more</em> abstract concepts like entertainment, enjoyment, engagement, amusement, challenge, meaning, etc.)</p>

<p>This is the first Tomb Raider game I&rsquo;ve ever completed. No guidebooks too.</p>
