      <title>1-to-1 Correspondence in Game Controls</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhikkpsqJTs&#34;&gt;Super Pole Riders - How We Got Full Pole Control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s Bennett Foddy talking at GDC about having a 1-to-1 correspondence between the controller and the in-game feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game feel is often discussed in subjective and almost &amp;ldquo;handwavey&amp;rdquo; terms(e.g. &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;It feels good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;), so it’s really helpful to have someone examine it from a very specific and precise perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, having players self-enforcing the 1-to-1 correspondence and that weird elbow trick were really clever.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unpacking</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/unpacking/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://gdcvault.com/play/1021972/Failure&#34;&gt;Failure Workshop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Adam Saltsman talks about unpacking as the ability for a player to understand what were the events that led up to his failure. He mentions that some games unpack naturally, while for others you just can’t seem to engineer this property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is a game that’s hard to unpack necessarily a worse game?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I think about a game like Threes or Drop7, it can be hard to pinpoint exactly which was the move that contributed to my eventual demise. To me that hints at a level of non-apparent depth waiting to be uncovered, and it makes me inclined to invest more time in a game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with a lot of things, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to think of &amp;ldquo;unpackability&amp;rdquo; as a scale along a slider rather than a binary thing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drivey Car</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/drivey-car/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2016 21:38:43 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wetlag.com/post/drivey-car/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoyed this one-button, driving &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drivey-car/id1062091463?mt=8&#34;&gt;game&lt;/a&gt; in which you could &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; steer left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay consists of driving round the same simple track until you crashed. Personally, it captured that &lt;a href=&#34;http://wetlag.com/post/flappy-birds-difficulty&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;frustration aesthetic&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; of Flappy Bird in a way that Crossy Road never did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yellow coins, the in-game currency, spawn as you go around the track. There are also red coins, which make you go faster and leave flaming tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered my first blue coin shortly after reaching a score of 10. I was not expecting it at all when my car started swerving wildy, and I promptly wrecked my car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;WTF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was such a defining moment between the game and me, because it became this personal &lt;em&gt;story&lt;/em&gt;. I may have played Flappy Bird for a much longer time, but no stories ever came out of it because all the pipes were the same and there was no specific point around which a story could form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think these simple coins have a great deal of merit as a game mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The red coins primed players to expect interesting effects from picking up colored coins. And the great thing was, these red coins didn&amp;rsquo;t feel punishing. Going faster made the game harder, but not by that much. Besides, going fast &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; good, and flaming tracks are cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that sense red coins were really a gentle introduction to their more brutal blue cousins. But even though the swerving felt random and wild initially, I eventually developed an intuition for driving under their influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the game, these coins carved out the peaks and troughs of my excitment level. Here are some examples of my inner thoughts while playing the game:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just cruising along&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m doing GREAT!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coin spawned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;d better be careful not to pick that up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accidentally picked up coin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;rdquo;&amp;ldquo;Oh shit oh shit.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coin effect wore off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Phew! I&amp;rsquo;m doing GREAT!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that these coins never felt unfair, because it’s always my fault when I couldn’t avoid them. They&amp;rsquo;re a great way of providing progressively harder challenges to overcome, and they make players wonder what&amp;rsquo;s gonna come next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made it to 30 rounds, but I crashed before any new colored coin spawned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I wonder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flappy Bird&#39;s Difficulty</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/flappy-birds-difficulty/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 16 Jan 2016 07:00:14 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We tend to attribute the infuriatingly addictive nature of Flappy Bird to its maddening difficulty, but I think what really kept us playing was our constant indignation at how easy it &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sometimes easy to miss the difference when designing a game with a similar &amp;ldquo;frustration aesthetic&amp;rdquo;. Such a game should be way harder than it looks, and yet still feel fair. (Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why Swing Copters never took off. That game &lt;em&gt;looked&lt;/em&gt; hard.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty ramp in Flappy Bird was a curious thing. Assuming that the probability of hitting a pipe was 10%, the probability of getting past the 5th gap would be 1 - (1 - 10%)^5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s approximately 40%, which is &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; than 10% * 5 = 50%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we associate probability with difficulty, this means getting past the fifth pipe isn&amp;rsquo;t five times as hard as passing the first; it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;. The hundredth pipe feels so much more intense than the first because there is &lt;strong&gt;disproportionately&lt;/strong&gt; so much more to lose. (Related: Michael Brough’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://mightyvision.blogspot.co.uk/2013/06/non-linear-costs.html&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; on non-linear costs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, we subconsciously recognise this without having to think through the math. Even as I write this I realize it’s kind of obvious, but I guess that’s part of why I keep this design notebook &amp;ndash; to formalize and understand at a deeper level why some of these things are “obvious”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, I miss that game.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feedback for Swipe Input</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/feedback-for-swipe-input/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2015 20:37:48 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wetlag.com/post/feedback-for-swipe-input/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried this game Heatos on my phone the other day, which involved swiping tiles around on a grid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tiles only moved  &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you’ve completed a swipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Threes&lt;/em&gt; handles swipe input really well. The moment you start a swipe, the tiles move a little. You can slide your thumb or finger back and forth until you’ve decided to commit to a move, and the tiles will move in corresponding fashion.
Beyond providing feedback, it doubles as a preview of your intended action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when tiles can’t be moved, there’s a subtle stretch and squash effect to indicate so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point is, there’s feedback throughout the entire duration of a swipe, not just at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lara Croft GO</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/lara-croft-go/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 07:47:51 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wetlag.com/post/lara-croft-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a fondness for the Tomb Raider series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I played the first four games in the franchise as my dad sat beside me and gave suggestions when I inevitably got stuck. We bought guidebooks and somehow still managed to get lost sometimes. The first guidebooks were black and white, and the screenshots weren’t very clear. I remember how excited I was when they were finally printed in colour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lara Craft Go is the first Tomb Raider game I’d played since then and even though the gameplay was very different, it wafted nostalgia. It&amp;rsquo;s not just the radial menu and the occasional handstand. It&amp;rsquo;s that sense of wonder exploring ancient monuments filled with traps and treasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s well executed, and gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mechanics were gently introduced, and then reused and recombined. For example:&lt;br /&gt;
-  Pressure plates could be deactivated by killing the creatures standing on them.&lt;br /&gt;
-  Torches that protected you against the creatures could also &amp;ldquo;push&amp;rdquo; them back onto pressure plates.&lt;br /&gt;
-  Pillars could stop rolling boulders, block dart traps, alter the creatures&amp;rsquo; paths. They could be pushed onto pressure plates, onto creatures, and onto other pillars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a concept Jon Blow and Marc Ten Bosch called &amp;ldquo;compatibility of mechanics&amp;rdquo; in their &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/OGSeLSmOALU?t=2311&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt;. (There are a few other &amp;ldquo;virtues&amp;rdquo; from the talk which applies to this game too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controls for this game surprised me; I had expected the character to move to where I tapped, like in Monument Valley. Diagonal swipes felt a little unnatural at first, but were easy enough to get used to. This may be the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a swipe-based control scheme in an isometric game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think something like the tracing controls in &lt;a href=&#34;http://wetlag.com/post/a-good-snowman&#34;&gt;A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build&lt;/a&gt; would have worked well in this game. With turn-based games like this, it usually takes a few moves just to perform that one action you have in mind. In your head you&amp;rsquo;re thinking &amp;ldquo;I want to push that pillar there.&amp;rdquo;, but it translates into &lt;em&gt;swipe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;swipe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;swipe&lt;/em&gt; to move to the pillar, and then &lt;em&gt;swipe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;swipe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;swipe&lt;/em&gt; again to move it to your destination. It&amp;rsquo;s a very subtle thing, but I think the inefficient mapping from thought to execution makes the experience less smooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I surprised myself a little by enjoying this game, even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very challenging and many a time I was replaying levels and pixel-hunting for the secret vases in the game. (&lt;strong&gt;Aside:&lt;/strong&gt; It amazes me how strange and nebulous and even hollow I still find the concept of fun &amp;ndash; this subjective, swirling, conglomerate mess of even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; abstract concepts like entertainment, enjoyment, engagement, amusement, challenge, meaning, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first Tomb Raider game I&amp;rsquo;ve ever completed. No guidebooks too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love &lt;a href=&#34;http://agoodsnowman.com/&#34;&gt;this game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an economic efficiency to the game&amp;rsquo;s design; no element is wasted. For example, there are no &amp;ldquo;screens&amp;rdquo;. Settings options appear as thought bubbles over the character&amp;rsquo;s head, and the map &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the puzzle. The benches which the character can sit on, along with other interactable environmental objects, initially seemed to be nothing more than neat touches with no gameplay impact, but were later revealed to be secret gateways. Even the humble reset button turned out to be a really important mechanic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in awe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme informs the mechanics really well, so much so that it&amp;rsquo;s truly difficult to imagine the game being built around anything else. Puzzles you&amp;rsquo;ve solved(&lt;em&gt;aka&lt;/em&gt; snowmen) are left intact, and monument-like. They lend a sense of permanence and significance to your actions, which is then challenged in the secret second-half of the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good secret is hard to build, too.  Often, secrets are inserted into games almost for the sake of having them; they tend to be merely something for players to find. Like the reveal at the end of the film &lt;em&gt;the Prestige&lt;/em&gt;, I think a good secret changes your understanding of everything up till its discovery. I think this game has managed to pull it off in an organic and elegant way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a short and beautiful game. Ephemeral, like a snowman.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pick A Card</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/pick-a-card/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tip: When running a social deduction game, don&amp;rsquo;t deal the role cards out.
Instead of dealing the role cards out, have players &amp;lsquo;pick a card&amp;rsquo;&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s some weird psychological phenomenon wherein players can be grumpy about what they&amp;rsquo;re dealt, but if they pick the cards, their attitude is better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a psychology topic called Locus of Control. When you feel an internal Locus of Control, like choosing a card, you tend to be happier with the results, while an external Locus of Control, being given a card, makes you feel worse.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3n4pc0/tip_when_running_a_social_deduction_game_dont/&#34;&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a simple tweak that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the underlying mechanic. Yet it significantly improves the player experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Random Reinforcement in Games</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/random-reinforcement/</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;article-the-power-of-random-reinforcement-http-www-gamasutra-com-blogs-filipwiltgren-20150928-254722-the-power-of-random-reinforcement-php:1a2a2d9aad363bad5fde9f7b42449725&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Article:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/FilipWiltgren/20150928/254722/The_Power_of_Random_Reinforcement.php&#34;&gt;The Power of Random Reinforcement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;card-drawing-a-form-of-random-reinforcement:1a2a2d9aad363bad5fde9f7b42449725&#34;&gt;Card-drawing: a Form of Random Reinforcement?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The author gives the example of card-drawing, such as that in games like MtG or Hearthstone, as a form of random reinforcement. While I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with the concept, I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of it in the contexts of MMO loot drops and the &lt;em&gt;gacha&lt;/em&gt; mechanics we so often see now in mobile games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose I don&amp;rsquo;t really consider card-drawing as a form of random reinforcemt because that feeling of hoping for a particular outcome isn&amp;rsquo;t very consistent throughout an entire match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the start of a match, you feel excited as you hope for a good starting hand. And in subsequent card draws, there may be specific scenarios in which you&amp;rsquo;re praying really hard for a specific card(e.g. a good 2-drop, a counter, combo, etc). But notice how the desired card changes from turn to turn, and also that in general, each card draw fills you with &lt;strong&gt;varying intensities&lt;/strong&gt; of anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all card draws were created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps for that reason, Hearthstone may be addictive as a &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think anyone has ever been addicted to the specific act of &lt;em&gt;drawing cards&lt;/em&gt; itself. (&amp;ldquo;Okay just one more card. Promise.&amp;rdquo;) Contrast this with the just-one-more-try sentiment when playing Blackjack or a slot machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ethics-vs-values:1a2a2d9aad363bad5fde9f7b42449725&#34;&gt;Ethics vs Values&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the use of random reinforcement in games ethical? I doubt that absolute morality exists, so I tend not to think in those terms these days. Arguments about ethics tend to accomplish very little anyway. Instead, I find it more productive to consider what I value personally, and let these values guide my decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, getting people addicted to gambling, to buying and opening card packs, or to grinding endlessly for loot isn&amp;rsquo;t very admirable. (Again, I&amp;rsquo;m not passing any judgement here; I&amp;rsquo;m merely staing that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d like to spend my time and effort on that.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, I think about a game like the Binding of Isaac which I&amp;rsquo;ve sunk countless hours into. A big part of its appeal comes from that anticipation before entering an item room or devil room, and knowing that I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; get some super awesome item combo. Most roguelikes, with their random elements, tend to generate similar experiences. That&amp;rsquo;s random reinforcement right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, the Binding of Isaac is not just incredibly fun and addictive. It is also a beautiful game. So why is random reinforcement so distasteful in one scenario and yet palatable, even glorified perhaps in the other?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it a matter of degree? Of intention? Of context?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Side note: The article mentioned that slot machines very frequently show an &amp;ldquo;almost win&amp;rdquo; oucome. Are the odds actually skewed towards that? That&amp;rsquo;s just crazy manipulative.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Beacon and Clairvoyant Bullets</title>
      <link>http://wetlag.com/post/beacon/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Sep 2015 16:43:06 +0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://wetlag.com/post/beacon/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was searching around for this Ludum Dare &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.necessarygames.com/reviews/beacon-game-free-download-independent-windows-atmospheric-fantasy-singleplayer-casual-gamers&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beacon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; game to play, but unfortunately it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be available online anymore. I then somehow ended up playing this &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Ludum Dare &lt;a href=&#34;http://wootfu.com/beacon/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Beacon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; game instead, and this is the one I&amp;rsquo;m writing about here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around halfway through the game, you&amp;rsquo;re introduced to these turrets which shoot bullets at you. Except, they&amp;rsquo;re not shooting directly &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; you, but rather where they &lt;em&gt;predict&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;ll end up. To avoid getting hit, you would have to change your behavior after a bullet had been fired. (e.g. Move or jump if you&amp;rsquo;d been standing still, change direction or stop or jump if you&amp;rsquo;d been moving, etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be clear, they&amp;rsquo;re not homing bullets. Merely clairvoyant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a mechanic that&amp;rsquo;s easy enough to understand, but its consequences are a little more nuanced. There&amp;rsquo;s this subtle moment after &amp;ldquo;dodging a bullet&amp;rdquo; and watching it sail past when you acknowledge that hmmmm, yes, that would have hit me. It reminds me of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKl8CM1Cft4&#34;&gt;Oracle Billiards&lt;/a&gt; prototype that Jonathan Blow made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to try something by stringing together a few of these turrents, all of which would be firing in quick succession. As a player you would then have to constantly override your own decisions. I suspect that would feel rather frustrating, but at the same time I think it&amp;rsquo;d be this weird, interesting sort of frustration..?&lt;/p&gt;
